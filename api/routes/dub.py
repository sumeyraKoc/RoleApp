"""Single-player Listen and Repeat endpoints for Dub the Scene.

Scripts are stateless definitions served to the client. A player chooses one
character, listens to each line, records a repetition, and receives a word-level
score. Original audio and muted video are used only for verified public-domain
sources; otherwise lines are synthesized through TTS. Media timestamps share the
same timeline and are played by the client without server-side transcoding.

The included clips come from the public-domain films Charade (1963), Superman:
The Underground World (1943), Night of the Living Dead (1968), and Gulliver's
Travels (1939). Their titles and characters may still be protected as trademarks;
Praglish presents them only as educational dubbing exercises and does not imply
official affiliation.
